Phrocco is the start of a port of the rather nice literate documentation generator Docco to PHP

                  http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/
                  
                  
Alpha at this stage but feel free to take it for a whirl.

    pear install oneblackbear.pearfarm.org/phrocco-0.2.4
    
This will install the phrocco binary, just type phrocco for instructions.

Here's a very basic version of the output you can expect.
